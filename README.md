# Harctoolboxbundle
IrScrutinizer is a powerful program for capturing, generating,
analyzing, importing, and exporting of infrared (IR) signals.

This project consists of IrScrutinizer and dependent projects from
harctoolbox.org. It also contains some supporting third-party projects.

## Status

Although the program is to be considered as well tested, the current
project organization has been reworked recently, and is in the state
of rapid development. Previous versions are available on the
[download page](http://www.harctoolbox.org/downloads/index.html)

## Installation

Installation, including dependencies, is covered in detail in the
appendix of the manual IrScutinizer.html. This is built during the
program build. It can also be build directly by the script
tools/mk-irscrutinizer-html.sh.  It is also directly accessible
[online](http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html#Appendix.+Building+from+sources)
(may be behind the version here.)

## Dependencies backup

"Inspired" by the recent Soureforge outage, I decided to make the sources of the
dependencies available on www.harctoolbox.org. These are the
github/sourceforge repositories, corresponding to the right tag or
commit, but without any patches applies. These are:
