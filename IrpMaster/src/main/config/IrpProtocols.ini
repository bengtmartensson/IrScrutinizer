[documentation]
If you get a decode whose protocol name is
simply "48-NEC" that indicates the learned signal is not complete (usually caused by
not holding the original remote's button long enough during learning).  Enough of
the signal is present to accurately determining the device, subdevice and OBC numbers.
But not enough is present to determine whether the protocol is 48-NEC1 or 48-NEC2.

# This is the version from Graham's document
[documentation]
This protocol uses asynchronous data transmission that sends an 8-bit
byte with 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 2 stop bits.  The minimum
signal is one byte.  The protocol is reported as
AirAsync<i>n</i>-xx.yy. ...  where <i>n</i> is the number of bytes and
xx, yy, ... are the byte values in hexadecimal notation.

EFC_translation=LSB
[documentation]
This protocol signals repeats by the use of <A href="#repeat">dittos</A>.

The EFC numbering varies among the KM and RM versions of Aiwa.  Using OBC numbers is less confusing.

When using a non-combo version of Aiwa in KM, you must combine the
device and subdevice numbers as device+256*subdevice to get the number
KM calls "Device Code".  (Since subdevice is usually zero, that
combination is trivial).  In Aiwa combo in KM you use the subdevice as
"parameter" (on the setup sheet) and put the device in the byte2
column on the functions sheet.  RM follows DecodeIr's naming of Device
and Subdevice.

EFC_translation=LSB comp prefixed with last device bit
[documentation]
This is not a robust protocol, so <A href="#spurious">spurious decodes</A> are likely.

As of version 8.31, KM does not translate device to fixed data, nor
OBC to EFC according to the same rules used by DecodeIr.  RM does
translate consistently with DecodeIr, so you may find it easier to use
RM.  If you use KM, you must change the device number as follows:

<ul>
<li>Decoded device 0 or 4 --> KM device 3</li>
<li>Decoded device 1 or 5 --> KM device 2</li>
<li>Decoded device 2 or 6 --> KM device 1</li>
<li>Decoded device 3 or 7 --> KM device 0</li>
</ul>

Also (in KM) you should use the EFC number from the decode not the OBC
number.  Akai protocol uses the same EFC numbering across all JP1
remotes, so use of EFC is safe.  KM uses different OBC numbering than
RM and DecodeIr, so use of OBCs isn't safe.

Amino equipment use both 37 and 56KHz, but the duration of the half-bit is
always 268.  Zaptor is a closely related protocol which for which the half-bit duration is 330.
IRDecode v2.43 distinguishes between Amino and Zaptor in order of priority by 1)the position of the toggle bit,
2)the value of the next to last nibble, and 3)the measured duration of a half-bit.
# In the IRP notation, T is an 8-bit toggle variable such that T is 0
# for the start frame and takes a common nonzero value M for all repeat
# frames.  C is a checksum given by

#   C = (D^T^S^F^FF^(((F^FF)&(T^M))<<1))|$F0 with FF = F:1:4*((F<<1)&(F<<2)&(F<<3))

# where X<<n means X shifted left n places, with 1's filling the empty
# places to the right and | means bitwise-OR. DecodeIR v2.37 checks T
# and will report in the Misc field if the start frame is missing.

# This protocol has been identified from one example, the Aminet110 STB,
# which has M=4. If the calculated and actual checksums differ, then the
# XOR of the two is given in the Misc field as a parameter N.  A nonzero
# N is an indication that the checksum formula is probably wrong for
# data more general than that in the known example.

A Denon signal has two halves, either one of which is enough to fully decode
the information. A significant fraction of Denon learned signals contain just
one half or have the halves separated so that DecodeIr can't process them
together. When one half is seen separate from the other, DecodeIr will name
the protocol Denon{1} or Denon{2} depending on which half is decoded. Denon,
Denon{1} and Denon{2} all represent the same protocol when they are correct.
But only Denon is robust. A Denon{1} or Denon{2} decode might be <A href="#spurious">spurious</A>.

There are six variants of the DirecTV protocol, distinguished in
RemoteMaster by the parameter "Parm" on the Setup page.  The Parm
value is shown in the Misc field of DecodeIR.  The IRP notation above
corresponds to the default Parm=3.  The various Parm values correspond
to three different frequencies (the 38k in the above) and two
different lead-out times (the -50 in the above).  The corresponding
values are:

<ul>
<li>Parm=0 : 40k, -15
<li>Parm=1 : 40k, -50
<li>Parm=2 : 38k, -15
<li>Parm=3 : 38k, -50
<li>Parm=4 : 57k, -15
<li>Parm=5 : 57k, -50
</ul>

Portions of a dirty learn of a Sony signal may look like a DirecTV
signal.  So, if you get a DirecTV decode together with a plausible
Sony decode, believe the Sony decode and ignore the DirecTV.  If you
get a DirecTV decode without a Sony decode for some functions of a
Sony device, try relearning them; a DirecTV decode for a signal meant
for a Sony device is not likely to be correct.

The unit number shows up in the Subdevice field of DecodeIr's output.
In KM, the "unit code" is one greater than the unit number.  So you
must take the Subdevice from the decode and add one to it and use that
as the "unit code" in KM.

There are two variants of the protocol executor for DishNetwork with different
but compatible EFC numbering. The decoded EFC should work for both. But the
results may be less confusing if you use OBC numbers in KM or RM.

JVC{2} indicates a JVC signal from which the lead-in is missing.  The JVC protocol has
lead-in on only the first frame, so it is quite easy to have it missing from a learned
signal.  So when JVC{2} is correct, it means the same as JVC.  But JVC{2} is not robust,
so <A href="#spurious">spurious decodes</A> are likely.  It
is also very similar in structure and timing to <A href="#Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</A> protocol, so that
DecodeIr has difficulty distinguishing one from the other.  The device number, OBC and EFC
are all encoded the same way between the two.  So if you have JVC{2}
decodes that you have reason to suspect should actually be Mitsubishi, you can try using
them as Mitsubishi without changing the numbers.  However, true Mitsubishi signals will not
misdecode as JVC, just as JVC{2}.  So if some of the signals for your device decode as JVC
and others as JVC{2}, you should trust all those decodes and not try Mitsubishi.

This is the nominal form of the Kaseikyo.  It is most commonly seen
with OEM codes 170.90, which indicates "Sharp".  I assume (haven't
tested) that the SharpDVD protocol in KM generates these
Kaseikyo-170-90 signals.  We have also seen this protocol with OEM
codes 3.32.  I'm not sure what manufacturer that indicates.

The Kaseikyo protocol in KM seems to be designed to produce this
nominal form of Kaseikyo for any specified OEM codes and any constant
value of E.  That should be the way to reproduce any Kaseikyo-???-???
decode other than SharpDVD, and might be better than SharpDVD for the
Kaseikyo-170-90 signals.

This is an unusual protocol in that an 8-bit device code and 8-bit OBC
are encoded in a 24-bit error-correcting code as the X of the IRP
notation.  This is constructed as follows.  First two parity bits are
appended to the 16 data bits to give even parity for the two sets of 9
bits taken alternately.  The resulting 18-bit sequence is then treated
as 6 octal digits (0-7) expressed in 3-bit binary code.  These are
then re-coded in the 3-bit Gray code (also called, more descriptively,
the reflected-binary code) with a parity bit to give odd parity, so
giving 6 4-bit groups treated as a single 24-bit sequence.  The whole
thing allows any single-bit error in transmission to be identified and
corrected.

the standard toggle bit zero, with the OEM1 field equal to 128, and
with a nonstandard (for the RC6 family) toggle bit added. If all those
rules are met, DecodeIr will display the name as "MCE" and with the
OEM2 field moved to the subdevice position.  Otherwise it will display
RC6-6-32.

As of version 8.31, KM does not have built-in support for this
protocol, but there are KM format upgrade files available for Media
Center (built by an expert who isn't limited to KM's built-in
protocols).  Those upgrades should be adaptable to any RC6-6-32 code
set (by changing the fixed data), if the one you have doesn't already
match the upgrade.

A few devices use NEC1 protocol at 40Khz, rather than the typical
frequency.  When getting a decode of NEC1, if you notice that the
frequency is closer to 40Khz than to 38Khz, examine multiple learns
from the same device to estimate whether the 40Khz frequency is a
learning error or a true characteristic of the device. If the 40Khz is
correct, there are methods in JP1, or MakeHex (whichever you are

Pioneer is distinguished from NEC2 only by frequency.  So if your
learning system does not learn frequency accurately, it won't
accurately distinguish Pioneer from NEC2.  All Pioneer signals should
have a device number in the range 160 to 175 and no subdevice.  No
NEC2 signal should fit those rules.  So you usually can determine
whether the decision (by frequency) was wrong by checking the device
numbers.

If you get a decode whose protocol name is simply "NECx" that

Enough of the signal is present to accurately determining the device,
subdevice and OBC numbers.  But not enough is present to determine the
exact protocol, which is probably NECx1 or NECx2.  This incomplete
learn also makes it harder to distinguish NEC from NECx, so a decode

This protocol is a very limited design.  We have seen it used only in
the UEI setup code TV/0159, which is for some TVs brand named Fisher,
Sanyo and Sears.  It is not likely that any other code set uses this
protocol.  So if you get a correct decode of pid-0083 you probably
have a TV that can be controlled by the TV/0159 setup code.

As of version 8.31, KM does not translate OBC to EFC according to the
same rules used by DecodeIr.  RM does translate consistently with
DecodeIr, so you may find it easier to use RM.  If you use KM, you
should use the EFC number from the decode not the OBC number.
Pid-0083 protocol uses the same EFC numbering across all JP1 remotes,
so use of EFC is safe.  KM uses different OBC numbering than RM and
DecodeIr, so use of OBCs isn't safe.

Pioneer is distinguished from NEC2 only by frequency.  So if your
learning system does not learn frequency accurately, it won't
accurately distinguish Pioneer from NEC2.  All Pioneer signals should
have a device number in the range 160 to 175 and no subdevice.  No
NEC2 signal should fit those rules.  So you usually can determine
whether the decision (by frequency) was wrong by checking the device
numbers.

Many Pioneer commands are sent as combinations of two different
Pioneer signals.  This version of DecodeIr does not associate the two
signals together into one command. It decodes them separately. If you
get more than one of the same OBC from decoding a learned signal, that
just means the learning system failed to understand the repeat
pattern. It does not mean a two part signal. But if there are two
different OBCs (with the same or different device numbers) you have a
two part Pioneer signal.

Including a two part Pioneer signal in a KeyMove or upgrade is a
complex process that requires a good understanding of Pioneer signals
and of the Pioneer support in KM.  The signals don't vary much among
related Pioneer models.  So the best way to get an upgrade or hex cmd
including such signals is to look through existing Pioneer upgrades in
the JP1 group and find one that already includes the same (or nearly
same) signal.

The official (UEI) protocol executor for RC5x does not support EFC
numbers.  If you are creating an upgrade in KM or RM you should use
OBC numbers, not EFC numbers.  If you need the Hex Cmd for a KeyMove,
you should use the functions sheet of KM or RM to compute it for you
from the OBC and subdevice number.

In the functions sheet in KM you must put the subdevice number in the
byte2 column, which KM calls "unit code".

This protocol is commonly used in Sky and Sky+ remotes.  As of version
8.31, KM does not have built-in support for this protocol, but there
are KM format upgrade files available for Sky and Sky+ (built by an
expert who isn't limited to KM's built-in protocols). RM has built-in
support for RC6-M-20n protocol, which can be used to make Sky and Sky+
upgrades (or any other RC6-6-20 upgrades as long as the T bit is the
same for all learned signals, as it is with Sky).  To use RC6-M-20n
for RC6-6-20, you must leave the M field in RM's setup sheet with its
default value of 6, and you must set or leave the T field (if present)
to the value shown in all the decodes (which I assume will be 0).

RECS80 is a family of related protocols with the same structure, but
different timing.

These are moderately non robust protocols, so <A
href="#spurious">spurious decodes</A> are possible.

The timing differences are not definitive enough for DecodeIr to
identify which RECS80 version is which.  Instead it displays the
timing information in the "Misc" field of the output.  That will be
three numbers formatted as in this example: (157/5048/7572).

Using those three numbers and the frequency, you should be able to
determine whether the signals fit the 0045 version, the 0068 version,
the 0090 version or none of them.  You should look at all the learned
signals for your device together when doing that.  A single device
won't mix versions of RECS80, so any differences in frequency or
timing between learns is due to the IR learning process, not due to
any differences among the correct signals.  You should find one RECS80
version that is a good enough fit for all signals of the device.

For 0045,

<ul>
<li>frequency should be between 37000 and 39000</li>
<li>first timing number between 100 and 200</li>
<li>second timing number between 4500 and 5500</li>
<li>third timing number between 6800 and 8300</li>
</ul>

For 0068,
<ul>
<li>frequency should be between 32300 and 34300</li>
<li>first timing number between 130 and 250</li>
<li>second timing number between 5100 and 6300</li>
<li>third timing number between 7700 and 9500</li>
</ul>

For 0090,
<ul>
<li>frequency should be 0</li>
<li>first timing number between 0 and 40</li>
<li>second timing number between 4500 and 5500</li>
<li>third timing number between 6800 and 8300</li>
</ul>

You may find decodes that don't quite fit either.  If it almost fits,
it may be worth testing to see if it works, but it's most unlikely to
work if the second timing number is above the suggested max or the
third timing number is below the suggested min.  For example, I found
a decode with frequency 41879 and timing numbers (132,5092,7652).  The
three timing numbers are perfect for protocol 0045, but the frequency
is quite wrong.  I have no device to test with, but my guess is that
it would work anyway.  For protocol 0068, the third number 7652 is
below the minimum of 7700 making it quite unlikely to work.  I found a
different device with frequency 33333 and timing (450,5770,8656).  For
0068 all but the first number are perfect and I would be quite
surprised if it didn't work.  For 0045 the second number 5770 is too
high for the max of 5500, so it's unlikely to work.

The decodes for RECS80 all report EFCs for protocol 0045.  These are
not correct EFCs if you select a protocol other than 0045, so it is
better to use OBC numbers when creating a JP1 upgrade based on these
decodes.

not available.

The parameter <i>M</i> is either 1 or 2. It distinguishes two styles
of this protocol that have different purposes and very different
lead-out times L.  The 8-bit parameter Dx is a signed integer.  If Dx
> 0 then the style is Sejin-1, used for normal buttons of a remote
control.  If Dx < 0 then the style is Sejin-2, used for signals of an
associated 2- or 3-button pointing device.  E is a checksum seed, E=0
in the only known examples.  The checksum formula reflects that in the
UEI executor, so is presumed correct.

The protocol parameters Dx, Fx, Fy translate into device parameters in
different ways corresponding to the different uses of the protocol.
In Sejin-1 the device parameters are a Device Code, a SubDevice code
and an OBC as is common for many protocols.  Sejin-2 has two
sub-styles. One corresponds to the displacement of a cursor or other
pointer with device parameters (X, Y) that give the horizontal and
vertical components of the displacement (and which can be positive or
negative).  The other signals Button Up or Button Down for any of the
three buttons of the pointing device.  The Misc field of the DecodeIR
output displays these device parameters for the Sejin-2 signals.  The
relationship between these and the protocol parameters is beyond the
scope of this document.  The Misc field also displays an RMOBC value
for Sejin-2 signals, which is an artificial OBC value that can be used
as input to RemoteMaster to create the signal concerned.

The protocol parameters for Sejin-1 include a bit that marks the end
frame of a <A href="#repeat">repeat sequence</A>.  DecodeIR v2.37 and
later check this and will report in the Misc field if the end frame is
missing.  This will normally be due to the key still being held when
the learning process ends, so that the end frame gets omitted from the
learned signal.  For Sejin-2 signals that represent button operations
the signal does not repeat.  A single frame is sent on button down, a
different frame is sent once on button up.  Both frames can be
detected and distinguished by DecodeIR v2.37 and later but the button
up frame will not normally be present in a learned signal.

This is a mouse protocol.  The button press info is included in the
Device field.  The horizontal motion is in the Subdevice field, and
the vertical motion is in the OBC field.

The decode interface does not support returning negative Subdevice or
OBC.  So negative motions are represented by adding 64 to them.  The
numbers 1 to 31 represent positive motion.  The numbers 32 to 63 are
each 64 larger than the true negative motion, so 63 represents -1 and
32 represents -32.

EFC_translation=6-bit LSB comp, or that prepended with extra device bit.
[documentation]
This is not a robust protocol, so <A href="#spurious">spurious decodes</A> are likely.

DecodeIR2.42 deprecates Thompson (5 bits of device, and 6 bits of
function) and reports these signals as Thompson7 (4 bits of device and
7 bits of function).

Thomson includes a <A HREF="#toggle">toggle bit</A> so using learned
signals will have operational problems.  You should use <A
HREF="#jp1">KeyMoves or Upgrades</A> based on the decoded values,
rather than continue to use the learned signals.

There are two different variants of UEI protocol 004B which have
different EFC numbering. The decode lists both possible EFCs so you
could experiment to discover which is right for your model. But, if
you are creating an upgrade (rather than just KeyMoves) it is better
to use RM and use the OBC numbers from the decode (which are stable
across models of JP1 remote). As of version 8.31, KM does not have
support for Thomson protocol, so if you must make an upgrade in KM you
need to use pid:004B. For the URC-8040 and 8060 the second decoded EFC
should be right and the OBC values in KM should be wrong. For most
(maybe all) other models, the first decoded EFC should be right and
KM's default EFC to OBC translation should also be right.

The Device code is D, the SubDevice code is S and there are two OBC
values.  OBC1 is the high byte of F, OBC2 is the low byte of F. The
OEM code is normally 0x44 and is reported in the Misc field only if it
has a different value. The XMP-1 protocol is XMP with OBC2 = 0.  The
OBC field in DecodeIR then shows OBC1. The XMP-2 protocol is XMP with
OBC1 = 0.  The OBC field in DecodeIR then shows OBC2.

This protocol has a 4-bit toggle T that is 0 for the first frame and
normally 8 for all repeat frames.  There is, however, a variant in
which a further frame with T=9 is sent after the button is released,
separated from the preceding frame by the short leadout of 13.8m that
is used between two half-frames rather than the long lead-out of 80.4m
used at the end of all other frames.  When this frame is detected then
the Misc field displays "With Final Frame".  For this to be shown in a
learned signal, the button must be released before the learning
process times out, so a short button press is needed.

These are problem decodes because JP1 remotes don't typically learn
these signals accurately enough for a correct decode.  NG Prontos also
do a rotten job of learning these signals.  Older Prontos seem to do
fairly well.  DecodeIR v2.40 includes algorithms that attempt to
reconstruct a valid XMP signal from a corrupt learn, but it is
impossible to correct all learning errors and there can be no
certainty that a reconstruction is actually correct.

In a correctly learned or fully reconstructed signal there will be an
"XMP", "XMP-1" or "XMP-2" decode with device, subdevice and OBC values
that can be used with RemoteMaster or any similar program to
regenerate a clean signal.  The Misc field shows which algorithms, if
any, have been applied, as a list in brackets after any decode data in
this field.  There are notes below on the reliability of the various
algorithms.  When the protocol shows as (unqualified) XMP, both OBC
values are non-zero.  The OBC and Hex fields show OBC1.  The
corresponding values for OBC2 are shown in the Misc field.

The learned signal itself will certainly not be valid if any
reconstruction algorithms have been applied and it may not be so even
if it has been decoded without reconstruction.  The possible algorithm
indicators in the Misc field are as follows:

<ul>
<li>End (= Endpoint):  The lead-out burst is missing and has been inserted.  This is almost certainly correct.
<li>Rec (= Recovery):  Look-ahead has been used to recover a missing burst from the following repeat frame.  This is very likely to be correct.
<li>Cor (= Correction): Two bursts have been coalesced in the learning process, e.g. those for hex digits C and D, causing a C to appear as D or vice versa.
The error has been identified and corrected.  This is probably correct.
<li>Cal (= Calculated): A missing digit has been calculated from a checksum.  The digit is probably correct but it may be in the wrong place.  The most likely error in the reconstruction is that the two digits of the OBC are the wrong way round.
<li>Cal2 (= Calculated 2)  Two consecutive missing zero digits have been identified, corresponding to a zero OBC.  When this happens, the signal will always be shown as XMP-1.  The most likely error in the reconstruction is that it should actually be XMP-2.
</ul>

If a learned signal is good enough to be recognised as XMP but not
good enough to be fully reconstructed, the protocol will display with
a name of the form XMP:136.218-0F0F441A0A800F00

In IR.exe you'll need to widen the Protocol column to see the whole
thing. This represents intermediate data from an unsuccessful attempt
to decode a XMP signal.

The number in the position where the 136 is in this example represents
the time scale.  A number (like this example) that is near 137 is
reasonable.  A number much further from 137 indicates a more serious
learning or decoding problem.  The number in the position where the
.218 is in this example (it is not part of the 136) represents the
level of inconsistency in the individual hex digit decodes.  A value
greater than .100 means the hex digits aren't very reliable.

The hex string, where the 0F0F441A0A800F00 is, is the decoded data.
At least one digit is almost certainly wrong or the whole decode
wouldn't be displayed in this form.  With a JP1 learning remote, the
most common errors are that a digit is actually missing, in which case
the string will have fewer than 16 hex digits, or that two or more
digits which are decoded the same are actually different, so some of
them are correct and some are one value higher or lower.  Although the
reconstruction algorithms attempt to correct these types of errors, it
is not always possible.  In this example I happen to know the correct
signal.  One of the three F's is really an E and one of the two A's is
really a 9.  The correct string is 0E0F441A09800F00.

Almost all examples we've seen start with "0E0F441A0" or "060F44120".
But we've also seen upgrades from UEI for "0D1F441A0" and "0C2F441A0"
and "0B3F441A0".  The last 4 digits of the whole 16 digit string (if
they are correct) represent the Hex command needed to reproduce the
signal in a JP1 upgrade or KeyMove.  DecodeIR shows them as two 8-bit
OBC values, as described with the IRP notation above.

An unusual protocol, in that the number of bits in the function code
is variable.  It is represented in DecodeIR as the device code.  There
are also two lead-in styles, decoded as subdevice values 0 and 1.
Style 1 aka "double-start" is usually used in TV's, other appliances
use 0 aka "single start".  If the device code is >8 then the bytes
given in the Misc field as E = ... follow the OBC in the function code
value.

Protocol used by several manufacturers of 433MHz RF controlled
switches, like Intertechno, Duewi, ELRO, and the URC light control
kit, and many other. Appears to be introduced by the Taiwanese firm ARC
Technology, www.arctech.com.tw.  These codes correspond to switches
with code wheels, having an "House number" ranging from "A" to "P", in the
IRP above corresponding to D=1 up to 16 for "P". They also have an "Address",
ranging from 1 to 16, corresponding to the parameter "S" in the IRP. Note that
e.g. Intertechno makes switches "with" and "without" code wheels, the
latter having a much larger addressing space, and unfortunately cannot
be controlled by the present protocol. F=0 is the power off command,
F=1 the power on command. The power on command is also used for
dimming, both up and down.

In the URC-7781 the setup codes 2200,2201, up to 2215 correspond to
this protocol, 2200 for house A etc. up to 2215 for house "P".

This protocol is/was used by the so-called RS-200 RF (433MHz)
controlled switches, that was sold by Conrad Electronics. There is a
"house number" consisting of for digits, each in the range 1 to
4. These are called H1, H2, H3, and H4 in the IRP. There is also a
"device address". Officially, it ranges from 1 to 4, however, at least
on the hardware I tried, 5 can also be used and assigned to a
receiver. Also, 6 was working, and in fact controlled the "group"
consisting of all devices with address 1,...,5. For 7 and 8, no
function has been verified. F=0 is the power on command, F=1 the power
off command, and F=2 the power toggle command.

This IR protocol is very similar to NEC2, except the repeat behavior is different.
The second and additional frames of a repeating signal send the OBC + 128.
