IrScrutinizer can now be started by selecting it from the start menu,
or by double clicking the icon.

Provided the option "Add installation directory to path" has been selected,
the command line program IrpMaster can be started from a so-called
DOS-box using the command name "irpmaster". (Otherwise the full path
name will have to be used.)
