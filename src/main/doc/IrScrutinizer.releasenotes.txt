==============================================================================
Version 2.0.1. Released 2019-08-11.
(There was never a version 2.0.0.)

This release replaces the libraries DecodeIR (by John Fine),
ExchangeIR (by Graham Dixon), and IrpMaster (by myself) by
IrpTransmogrifier. This achieves synchronization between rendering and
decoding of IR signals: The same data base is used, and a protocol that can
be rendered can also (with very few exceptions) be decoded too.
(Milestone 2; #212, #280, #251, #23).
UEI learned as IR signal format has been eliminated (#217).

On all versions but the Macintosh, also IrpTransmogrifier as command line
program will be available (Command name: irptransmogrifier).

Documentation has not been updated ;-).

Open issues in this release:
  * MacOS 10.11.*: Crash in RXTX when closing serial USB device, #64.
  * RXTX on Windows has problems with Arduino's LLC driver, #229.

Associated user visible changes:

* A number of new protocol parameters  (Options -> Protocol Parameters -> *),
(#277). See IrpTransmogrifier for their semantic.
* Link to DecodeIR documentation has been replaced by a browse function of the
available functions

Other user visible changes have been kept to a minimum. Functionally significant
will instead appear in future versions.

However, there are some other user changes/improvements:

* Undo function for the data window of "Scrutinize signal",
(Actions -> Undo Scrutinize data; Ctrl-Z);  #275
* Some more icons.
* New output text format: raw without signs.  #250.
* Improved setup script setup-irscrutinizer.sh in the generic binary
distribution, for Linux-like operating system.
* Improved Linux x64 appimage, now containing its own Java JVM. (#279,
thanx Simon Peters, "probono"). Also allows IrpTransmogrifier to be called as
a command line program (#285).
* Windows installer now checks for the existence of Java (#278).
* Misc GUI tweaks (#274, #268)
* New output text format: raw without signs (#250).
* Improved parsing of IrSignals given as inputs. (#233)
* Prohibit (?) the user from selecting a non-existing export directory. (#288)
* Alternative version of librxtxSerial.so, using /var/lock/lockdev instead
  of /var/lock. (#263)
* New export format BracketedRaw. (#307)
* User's decoding parameters no longer overwrite protocol specific values. (#308)
* New help menu entry: Browse releases. (#309)
* Include IrpTransmogrifier.html and Glossary.html, from GUI callable. (#311)
* Minor doc updates (not complete).

Minor bugfixes:

* Export format "Pronto Hex Oneshot" bugfix. (#296)
* Fixed bug with export format name containing "/" on Windows (#290)
* Issue with decoding signals without repeat. (#295)
* Analyzer on Scrutinize signal falsely gets fallback frequency. (#289)

==============================================================================
Version 1.4.3, issued on 2019-06-12.

This release is the "second final" 1.*.* release; based on IrpMaster
as rendering engine and DecodeIR (as decoding engine). Further
releases will be based on IrpTransmogrifier instead, and will be
numbered 2.*.*. (see #212).

The release contains a few rather important bug fixes, and implements
HTTP proxy for http network acccess.

Old MacOSes (<= 10.7 "Lion") appear not to be compatible with Java 8u162
and later (see https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/7945).
(This is strictly speaking not an IrScrutinizer issue.)

Documentation has not been updated ;-).

Open issues in this release:
  * MacOS 10.11.*: Crash in RXTX when closing serial USB device, #64.
  * RXTX on Windows has problems with Arduino's LLC driver, #229.

Note:

Once, I planned to use the version name "1.5.0" for the version following 1.4.1.
So there was some snapshot builds called 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT. Then I decided that 1.4.2
was more appropriate. Differently put, there has
not been and will not be a 1.5.* release. I apologize for the confusion.

- Remove unused DTD support (#94).
- irscrutinizer.sh: (wrapper) improved location of apphome.
- Added some XML files from W3C and Apache, adapted the XML catalog
  in order to make the project more self contained, and to allow
  validation without network access.

GUI:
- Remove text "Analyzer result unavailable" (it looks like an error),
  Ditto for DecodeIR. If analyzer not enabled, clean the field "AnalyzeIR"
  when scrutinizing.
- Sort export formats in the GUI alpabetically (case insensitively).
- Load Tonto early, to dispose scary looking (but irrelevant) loading errors.
- New entries in the Help menu: issues, Feedback, Git repository #115.
- An active capture on "Scrutinize remote" now disallows capture
    on "Scrutinize signal" and "Capturing hw"/Test (#109).
- Store last used import format persistently in properties. #108
- Handle attempts to hide non-existing columns more gracefully.
- Middle mouse in the scrutinze-remote tables now transmits the signal
  under the mouse.
- Barf on no and multiple selections in some table functions.
- Update the GUI menus after reloading export format data base (#83).
- Issue confirmation if Girr-exporting with "everything" deselected.
- Paste in the data window of "Scrutinize signal" now replaces newlines
  by spaces, #75.

  girr_ns.xsd. (#84). New documentation files.
- xinclude now supported in Girr files. #107.
- CommandsSet import: Fixed nasty bug in getting the protocol of children, #118.
- girr[_ns].xsd: change definition of appParameter (allow string as value).
- Girr instances now accept hexadecimal number prepended by 0x
  for parameter values. Removed attribute display-name, there is already
  a displayName. General cleanup in girr.xsd.
- (Girr) change name uniqueness for command names #85
  Now the command names are required to be unique within the CommandSets,
  not in the remote.
- Implemented multi-toggles for Girr.Command. (#104)
- Parse hexadecimal numbers (etc) as parameters in Girs import (#70).
- Girr: cleanup of command API #105.

- Girr: do not give up completely on non-renderable signals #69

Import:
- Improved error message for parse errors.
- Minor parse robustness improvements for raw signals.
- Import signals: if a particular command is erroneous, just ignore
  *that command* instead of aborting the entrie import.
- Parser for Lirc files rewritten from scratch (#101).
- Some cleanup of Jirc API, doc fixes.
- Mode2Importer: Do not require pulses and spaces to be interleaving.
- User selectable character set for import #93 (Options -> Import

Version 1.1.3

Open Issue: MacOS 10.10.5: Crash in RXTX when closing serial USB device,
(https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer/issues/64).

- Offers to nuke properties if fatal error during startup (#62).
- Reset properties makes backup (#59).
- Link to tutorial under help menu.
- Fixed broken CSV-import using regexp (e.g. "WHITESPACE").
- Removed "smart" incrementing of serial device, broke the USB serial
devices on Windows, and had severed problems on the others.
- Arduino sources no longer distributed with the program (they are
available on https://github.com/bengtmartensson/AGirs).
- New implementation of MacOS App build, without proprietary components.
- Cleaned up version management in poms.
- SendingHardwareManager: handle exceptions in select better.
- LircClient: nuke trailing (and leading) spaces before comparision.
- Helptext and documentation update.
- Made file/tree importer more intuitive: tree cleared when invalid.
  "Import all" and "Import all/raw" disabled when more than 10 remotes in tree.
- Importers now import remotes with some of the commands erroneous
    or unparseable. These are just "ignored", instead of causing an abort.
- Read CML files as WINDOWS-1252 (educated guess).
- Removed external dependency of de.moldaner.wakeonlan
- Robustness fix in AmxBeaconListener.
- Java version required is now 1.7 (source and target).

  menu. New public function IrPlotter.createPopupClone().
- Implemented Cml- and CommandFusion-import.
- TreeImporter: when a remote node is expanded, decode its children,
  i.e. its commands.
- Sort the remotes in TreeImporter alphabetically.
- Switch to busy cursor in FileImporterBean.loadFileButtonActionPerformed().
- Removed Option -> Output text format -> UEI Learned.
    Reason: Very little use, high confusion potential.
- Support for the CommandFusion Learner, sending and capturing
- Layout fix: increased width of module & port combos for global cache.
- sometimes erroneous HardwareUnvailableException when using GlobalCache.
- New protocol Roku-Official, contributed by mdavej.
- Robustness improvement (resolve symlinks to device etc).
- Fixed bug in Import/Text/Parametrized: Field separators erroneous.

Version 1.1.2
- On Unix-like systems, can now be installed on the local machen by
  "mvn deploy".
- Now both Fedora rpm version and a Mac OS X app!
- Sources available at Github
  (https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer). Reorganized as
  Maven project.
- Now using the babelfish icon. Remove icons with unclear legal status.
- New command line option --nuke-properties.
- Use the (new?) Crystal-Clear icons instead of the (old?) crystal.
- Fixed bug in Lirc/NEC1-exporter: when S was missing, replacement S
  was being reversed twice.
- Now the debug code can be set from GUI: Options -> Debug -> Debug Code...
- Loading of the "local" jni libraries now from subdirs of apphome.
- Removed pdf files and the glossary (at least for now) -- makes
  distribution and packaging easier.
- Removed a few unneeded documentation links under help.

  is now used by the Lirc project. Also, when importing Lirc files,
  the extension .conf is possible.
- (IrpProtocols.ini) "New" protocols Sharp{1} and Sharp{2}.
- Removed dead command line options
- Adhere to Freedesktop configuration files standards:
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
  (on other platforms than Windows).

- Import and export in Lirc Mode2 format

Version 1.1.1
- New export format: IrToy-bin
- New importer: IrTrans
- Fix bug in Hexcalc when number > 65535.
- Splash screen on startup.
- Multiple decodes from DecodeIR are no longer "censored" (in all places).
- Parametric remote -> Advanced -> "Set misc. parameters" now replaces
all old parameters except D, S, F, and T.
- Fixed unclear semantic of "count" sends of an IrSignal.
- Fixed issue with sending by IrToy.

Version 1.1.0a.
- IrToy: fixed several issues. (Only FW version 222 is supported.)
- the count for transmit generated is now a saved property.
- csv-importer: can now parse hexadecimal numbers starting with 0x.

Version 1.1.0.
- Arduino: handle timeouts from serial port better.
- Smarter scrolling of Scrutinize remote tables.
- Individual silly commands are now forgiven (ignored) in rmdu import.
- If an import to a fails, clear the associated tree -- it is
confusing to leave something from another import as-is.
- Option "Output text format" now defaults to CCF.
- Improved Arduino-support, using "Arduino GirsLite" (see
arduino/GirsLite/README), new ArduinoInterface to new Arduino firmware.
- CSV-import, raw and parametrized: New option "multi column name".
- Support the improved API of IRDB, thus the performace problems are fixed.
- Implemented Set Misc Params in Parametric remote.
- The option "Invoke Analyzer on Imports" renamed to "Invoke
Analyzer". Menu option moved to Options (was Options->Import
options). It now governs the invokation of the analyzer not only on
import but also on scrutinization of individual signals.
- Changing export directory sometimes did not take effect until after
a restart, see
http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14986&start=21

- Implemented offerStackTrace, offering stack traces by exception
popups.
- If scrutinizing a signal containing durations of zero length,
refuse, and allow the user to enter a replacement value.
- The option "Invoke Analyzer on Imports" renamed to "Invoke
Analyzer". Menu option moved to Options (was Options->Import
options). It now governs the invokation of the analyzer not only on
import but also on scrutinization of individual signals.

Version 1.0.1
- Now possible to select baud rate for serial sending/capturing
devices (Arduino, IrToy).
- Included Michael Dreher's "Ir_Widget" capture software for Arduio.
- New command line option: -x|--experimental, used to selectively
show/hide "experimental" features. (Cannot be switched from GUI.) For
now, the generic serial IR command sender is only showed when this
option is selected.

Version: 1.0.0:
- Importing CSV parametrized and raw is now possible from clipboard.
- (HarcHardware) Fixed file descriptor leak in the
AmxBeaconListener/GlobalCacheListener.
- If editing (open last export) fails, fall back to "open".
- Remove prefiltering when importing Girr (only GUI elements were
implemented)
- Generating: Bugs, (e.g. misbehavior when no D present in protocol), fixed.
- CCF of type 0100 are now parsed.
- Fixed bug when pressing cancel for createUser.
- now inquires for device data (manufacturer etc) when exporting
commands, can be turned off by Options -> Export options -> Inquire
device data.
- New option: "Ignore T on parametric learns".
- Parameters in the parametrized table can now be removed by entering an empty string
- The sequences in the raw table are now really read-only, previously
they could be manipulated, but the changes did not take
effect. (Editing could be implemented, but is probably not worth it.)
- Text importers now makes command names unique by appending "$" and a
number if necessary.
- Now a class IrpMaster for firing up the commmand line IrpMaster.
- If option Import/Open ZIP files is selected, will import from zip
files directly.

- appHome and java.library.path now computed dynamically. Thus the
windows start-up wrapper has been eliminated.
- New export formats: spreadsheet, RMFunctions, ICT.
- Cloning of plot implemented (but rather primitive).
- New export formats: ICT, Spreadsheet, and RMFunctions.
- Improved documentation and help texts.
- Added glossary.
- Improved startup of the serial stuff: Now searches for all serial
  ports, but only once (by caching). (On windows, cases somewhat slow
  startup :-\ )
- Misc bug fixes, layout fixes, cleanups.

2012-11-12: Version 0.1.0
Very first version with many rough edges. Not tested very
much. Documentation not written. Popup texts also not written.

Known issues:
      Documentation largely missing.
      Popop help texts not written
      Serial communication generally unreliable. Plan: replace rxtx.
      Generally rough layout.
      Some glitches in the IR plotter, like sometimes silly time scale.
