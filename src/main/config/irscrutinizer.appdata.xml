    <summary>Powerful program for capturing, generating, analyzing, importing, and exporting of infrared (IR) signals</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            IrScrutinizer is a powerful program for capturing, generating, analyzing,
            importing and exporting infrared (IR) signals.
        </p>
        <p>
            For capturing and sending IR signals several different hardware sensors
            and senders are supported. IR Signals can be imported not only by capturing
            from one of the supported hardware sensors (among others: IrWidget,
            Global Caché, and Arduino), but also from a number of different file formats
            (among others: LIRC, Wave, Pronto Classic and professional,
            and different text based formats; not only from files, but also from the
            clipboard, from URLs, and from file hierarchies), as well as the Internet
            IR Databases by Global Caché and by IRDB.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imported signals can be decoded, analyzed, edited, and plotted. A collection
            of IR signal can thus be assembled and edited, and finally exported in one of
            the many supported formats.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program contains the powerful IrpTransmogrifier IR-renderer, which
            means that almost all IR protocols known to the Internet community can be
            generated.
